<h1 align="center">My Portfolio Website </h1>

This is a simple responsive portfolio website made by using template of [Lilykhan786](https://github.com/Lilykhan786) which you can find [here](https://github.com/Lilykhan786/PortfolioTemplate).
I am currently trying to make changes to it acc to my needs.

## Used here:
+ **HTML5** for markup
+ Pure **CSS3** for styling 
+ Bit of **Jquery** to make header animation effects work
+ Bit of **JavaScript** to make a hamburger menu to work on mobile devices 
+ **Font Awesome** for Icons 
+ **Unsplash** for Images
